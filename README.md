# Phase-1-Project - Cryptocurrency data

Cosmo's Crypto is a website that displays the data of five of the most popular cryptocurrency.

You can like whichever cryptocurrency you want to keep up to date on with a button so you remember when you need to look back at the website.

If you already know which currency you want to see the data on you can use the search bar to bring up only the specified item, or search up two in order to compare the both to eachother.
